              I love Javascript, UI design and CSS. You can find me devouring books somewhere around Barceloneta Beach.
              <br/>
              <br/> Or pretending I'm strong at calisthenics park.

        <h1 class="title">Who am I</h1>
        <p>I was born on 1990 on a humble family around Madrid. When I was a kid I cannot stop drawing and writting stories.
          Also, I have a huge library that my mother says I read when I was at school.</p>

        <p>I wanted to study story. I really love to read about Romans, Greeks and learning their culture, traditions and legends.
          But 6 months after I started the college, I realized that was not for me.</p>

        <p>I was more creative than that. I couldn't just memorize dates and facts. So I quit. My mother was really sad and
          frustraded, as I was. But something happened. That's why started to believe that karma exists.</p>

        <p>A wonderful person that I was living with convinced me to study Software Engineering. I couldn't believe that was
          for me. Even if I loved computers, and do things with them. But somehow, I went to pick more information and I
          was amazed. I immediatly felt at home. So I decided to study there.</p>

        <p>It wasn't easy. I had no idea about mathematics, physics and that stuff. I spent 6 months preparing by myself for
          that, before the beginning of the degree. But somehow, four years and a half later, I became a Software Engineer.
        </p>

        <p>And the rest is history.</p>

        <p>Apart from that, I didn't stopped with my passions. I kept writting. And I started a illustration degree, but was
          so tough to do while I was working, so I stopped It. Past year I started a design one, but I had a lot of personal
          and professional problems and I quit.</p>

        <p>I don't think that those failures were something bad. I grew a lot and learn a lot from myself while doing them.
          Now I'm interested on online courses and Design meetups. I'm not going to stop at all. Just keep trying until I
          find the right formula for me.</p>
