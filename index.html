            strong at calisthenics park.

        <h1 class="title">Who am I</h1>
        <p>I was born on 1990 on a humble family around Madrid. When I was a kid I couldn't stop drawing and writting stories.
          Also, I have a huge library with everything that my mother says I read when I was at school.</p>

        <p>I wanted to study History. I really loved to read about Romans, Greeks and learning their culture, traditions and legends.
          But 6 months after I started the college, I realized that was not for me.</p>

        <p>I was more creative than that. I couldn't just memorize dates and facts. So I quit. My mother was really sad and
          frustraded, as I was. But something happened. That's why started to believe that Karma exists.</p>

        <p>A wonderful person that I was living with convinced me to study Software Engineering. I couldn't believe that was
          for me. Even if I always loved computers and to do things with them. But somehow, I went to request more information and I
          ended up amazed. I immediatly felt at home. So I decided to study there.</p>

        <p>It wasn't easy. I had no idea about mathematics, physics and that stuff. I spent 6 months preparing by myself for
          that, before the beginning of the degree. But somehow, four years and a half later, I became a Software Engineer.
        </p>

        <p>And the rest is history.</p>

        <p>Apart from that, I didn't stopped with my passions. I kept writting. And I started a illustration degree that couln't finish. 
          Past year I started a new design one, but couldn't handle it along with my job and I quit.</p>

        <p>I don't think that those failures were something bad. I grew a lot and learn a lot from myself while doing them.
          Now I'm interested on online courses and Design meetups. Also, working on a couple of personal projects that involve coding + UI design. 
          I'm not going to stop at all. Just keep trying until I find the right formula for me.</p>

      <h1 class="title">A day on my life</h1>
      <p>I'm a morning guy, so usually at 7:00 I jump out of the bed. After a quick shower, I get some breakfast. I like to
        work on my personal projects while I'm doing that, or watch some Surf or travel videos.</p>

      <p>Around 8:30 I arrive to work, prepare a coffee and then, time to read Slack, emails and write some
        todos for the day. If there's no meeting or important task to do, I start to code and attend to meetings.</p>

      <p>At 13:00, time to lunch. When I'm done, I love to get a coffee cup on a close coffee shop with some coworker and prepare
        the plan for the afternoon.</p>

      <p>On the afternoon, I keep doing my tasks until 17:30-18:00. Then, time to go home. A bit of chill time is needed.</p>

      <p>Around 20:30, If there's no design meetup, I get ready for some training at the bars or just a bit of good ol' jogging
        at the beach.</p>

      <p>At night, I prepare some healthy dinner, then I read or design some stuff and write my daily journaling, along with
        the tasks for the next day.</p>

      <p>Apart from my daily schedule, I'm a geek and I enjoy playing videogames a lot. Currently: XCOM 2, The Witcher 3 and Darkest Dungeon, one of my favorite of all the times.</p>

      <p>Also, I love writting scripts for games I would never create. Or maybe yes. Photography is also an upcoming interest
        for me. And traveling. A lot. Going to punk-rock/hxc gigs it's my thing from 8 years. Drawing and creating potential tattoos, t-shirts
        or logos is also something I enjoy al lot. And designing UIs for products that I would love to use. Cooking is my thing also.</p>

      <p>But the thing I enjoy the most is being with my family and friends. And petting my pug, called Ã‘ato.</p>
